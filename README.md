# Neural Network Project

This repository contains a project focused on implementing and experimenting with neural networks. The notebook explores various concepts and techniques related to deep learning, with detailed code and explanations.

## Overview

The primary goals of this project include:
- Developing a neural network from scratch.
- Exploring activation functions, loss calculations, and optimization techniques.
- Experimenting with different architectures and datasets.

The project is designed to be educational, providing both theoretical insights and practical implementation details for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of neural networks.

## Features

- Implementation of forward and backward propagation.
- Use of popular activation functions such as ReLU, Sigmoid, and Softmax.
- Gradient descent optimization.
- Visualization of training progress (e.g., loss and accuracy curves).
- Modular and reusable code structure for experimentation.
